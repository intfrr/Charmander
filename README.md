Charmander is designed to ease the process of designing and running useful, creative or just plain weird bots (and other types of applications
) that run inside [slack](https://www.slack.com)

It provides a semantic interface to sending and receiving messages so that developers can focus on creating novel applications and experiences instead of dealing with API endpoints.
